# Hash-table-and-overflow-handling-quadratic-probing
Implementation of hash table and overflow handling
     
 Write a program to insert a set of values into a hash table of fixed size (10). If collision occurred solve it by using quadratic probing. (Value of h as 11) 

Input: Integer elements

Output: Array a

Data Structure: Hash table 
 
Algorithm: 

Step 1. Start
 
Step 2. Array a[10] is initialized
 
Step 3.Value of h is assigned as 11
 
Step 4. Number of elements for the array is asked and the given user input is stored in n
 
Step 5. For loop with initial value of i being 0 & increasing till value not becoming n
   
    Step 5.1. 0 is assigned to a[i]
 
Step 6. For loop with initial value of i being 0 & increasing till value not becoming n
   
   Step 6.1. Value of e is obtained from the user
   
   Step 6.2. Value of e modulus h is assigned to pos
   
   Step 6.3. Do while loop initiated
   
   Step 6.4. If value of a[pos] is 0
     
      Step 6.4.1. Assign e to a[pos]
   
   Step 6.5. Else
     
      Step 6.5.1. If value of pos is 9
       
       Step 6.5.1.1. Assign -1 as the value of pos
      
      Step 6.5.2. Increase value of pos by b + j square
   
    Step 6.6. Step 6.4 to 6.5 is repeated if value of a[pos] is not equal to e
  
Step 7. For loop with initial value of i being 0 & increasing till value not becoming n
   
  Step 7.1 Print value of a[i] 
 
Step 8. Stop
